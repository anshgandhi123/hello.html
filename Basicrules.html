    <p>Like any sport, the NFL has rules you have to follow. While there are a lot of rules, some of them aren't as important to us. But if you are playing football for fun, or just decided to watch the NFL, there are some rules you should know!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A team has four chances to go ten yards. Otherwise, they give the ball to the other team.</li>
      <li>A team's objective is to get the ball into the end zone, a small area at opposite ends of the field. If you get into this endzone, you get 6 points. This is called a touchdown. </li>
      <li>After a touchdown, teams must either kick the football through uprights or try to get the ball in the endzone again. </li>
      <li>At one time, there are 11 defense platers and 11 offense players on a field.</li>
      <li>A team's defense has to try to prevent the offense from scoring by tackling the players to the ground.</li>
      <li>If an offense can't score a touchdown, they have an opportunity to kick the football to the other side of the field, a punt, to help prevent the opposing team's offense from scoring. </li>
      <li>Similarly, if an offense can't score but doesn't want to punt, they can try and kick the football through the uprights for 3 points. </li>
      <p>There are many more rules to football, including penalties, but these are just some basic rules. If you want to know more rules, click <a href= "https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2019-nfl-rulebook/">here.</p></a>
